# Free-Turtle-Hands-Chess
A very old python project to play chess using voice commands. Chess gameplay made from scratch.

<h5> The code here is extremely inefficent and I do not recomend this type of programming ever.</h5>
<h5> This project was a while back and personal methods of design and programming stratagies have inproved drastically.</h5>
